# Railway-Reservation-System
 The Railway Reservation System is a web app for booking train tickets. Users can register, search trains, book seats, and check PNR status. Admins manage trains and bookings. Built with Python, Django, and SQLite. Currently uses a dummy payment system, with plans to integrate real-world payment gateways soon.
